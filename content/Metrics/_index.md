> **The most important part of any transformation is measuring the productivity increase.** 

### Lines of code per developer

 We need to ensure our coders are focused on the feature for the next convoy. The fleet won 't wait! We also need to ensure we have balanced metrics to prevent a perverse incentive when we track who created defects. If we only track defects, the coder may try to assume the role of Unit Tester. That wastes time. Therefore, we need to measure the lines of code produced by each coder.

### Number of code review comments per convoy

Code review is important to make sure code is formatted correctly. We measure the number of review comments to make sure each coder is being critical enough of the work of other coders. 

### Tasks Delivered per Developer

For each developer, the number of tasks they complete during Convoy. By tracking the number of features each coder completes, more can be shipped in each Convoy. Volume is important. Let's turn it up to 11!

### SADMF Maturity Score

The precise execution of the SAD Delivery Lifecycle is critical to the success of SADMF. Without "excellent" maturity scores, your customers will have no confidence you used approved SADMF processes to deliver!

### Features Completed vs. Committed

The features delivered in the Convoy compared to what was planned 8 quarters ago.

### SADMF Adoption Rate

This is the percentage of the organization that is Certified SAD&trade;.
