## Why another DevOps Framework?

We know that transforming into a DevOps organization is hard. Many people will tell you there will be fundamental changes
required in how everything in your organization works. At Scaled Agile DevOps, we believe there is another way.

Using
our exclusive Maturity Framework, you can become a DevOps organization in less than 6 months with no disruption to your
organizational structure and a minimal training investment.

## Benefits of the Framework

- No need for investing in training teams beyond a few additional daily ceremonies.
- A clear, simple, manageable **Release Convoy** that customers can be assured used DevOps.
- Fully compatible with sending requirements to external development teams.
- Easy to plan 1, 2, or even 3 years worth of detailed deliveries.

## Getting Started

We suggest using the *[Certified Really Agile Practitioner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwbiSCgiZNA)* training as a method of learning the fundamentals you will need
to be certified SADMF.
