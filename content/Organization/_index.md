## Organizational Command Structure

### Source Management Team

To improve coder productivity by reducing the work required for integrating changes, we introduce the Source Management Team. The SMT is responsbile for accepting the complete [feature branches](../practices/#fractal-based-development) from each coder and merging the changes into the Conflict Resolution branch. They will then resolve all conflicts for the coders before alerting the Quality Control team that the Convoy is ready for testing.

### Quality Authority

Verifying quality is a specialist field that no coder is qualified to perform. In addition, performing testing impedes the ability for the coder to do their job, write code. The Quality Authority team is the final arbiter of what the requirements mean and will create, maintain, and manually execute tests scripts based on their understanding of the requirements. The end-user uses the system manually, so that is the only TRUE way to test it!
